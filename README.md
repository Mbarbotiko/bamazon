# Bamazon

### Bamazon 
* Bamazon is a **Node App with a MySQL Database.**  You will be unable to link to my Bamazon DB I have linked a video of the apps functionality at the bottom of this read me.

* The application on start up will display items in Bamazon's database as a store front with an item ID, Product Name, Department Name , and Price.  The Stock Quantity is listed in the DB but not on the store front.

* The user will be asked to select the ID of the item they would like to purchase.  Then select the quantity.

* The database will then be queried and the stock quantity will be checked to ensure there is enough for the user to purchase.  If the exchange is successful the user will be prompted a message that says their purchase was successful with the dollar amount they have spent on the purchase, if there is not enough product, a try again message will be displayed along with the items in store with descriptions.

* All of the items in the DB will be depleted as the user continues to shop until they reach 0 stock quantity.  The second step to this application is to create an application that handles a managers view to re-stock the store, which will be completed at a later date.
